## 📊 Methodology, Results, and Analysis

### 🔹 Methodology (TOPSIS Workflow)

The web application implements the standard **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** methodology to rank alternatives based on multiple criteria. The complete workflow is executed using a custom-developed PyPI package and is described below:

1. **Input Data Collection**
   - The user uploads a CSV file through the web interface.
   - The **first column** represents the alternatives.
   - The remaining columns contain **numeric criteria values**.

2. **Weight and Impact Definition**
   - The user provides:
     - **Weights** representing the importance of each criterion.
     - **Impacts** where `+` denotes a beneficial criterion and `-` denotes a non-beneficial criterion.

3. **Normalization of Decision Matrix**
   - Criteria values are normalized using vector normalization to eliminate the effect of differing units and scales.

4. **Weighted Normalized Matrix**
   - Each normalized value is multiplied by its corresponding weight to incorporate relative importance.

5. **Ideal Best and Ideal Worst Solutions**
   - **Ideal Best Solution:** Best values for each criterion based on impacts.
   - **Ideal Worst Solution:** Worst values for each criterion based on impacts.

6. **Distance Calculation**
   - Euclidean distances of each alternative are calculated from:
     - Ideal Best solution
     - Ideal Worst solution

7. **TOPSIS Score Calculation**
   - The relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution is computed as:
     ```
     TOPSIS Score = Distance from Ideal Worst /
                    (Distance from Ideal Best + Distance from Ideal Worst)
     ```

8. **Ranking of Alternatives**
   - Alternatives are ranked in descending order of TOPSIS scores.
   - A higher score indicates a more preferred alternative.

All computations are performed using a **custom-built PyPI package**, ensuring modularity, correctness, and reusability.

### 🔹 Result Table Explanation

After computation, the application generates an output CSV file with the following structure:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Alternative | Name of the alternative |
| Criteria Columns | Original numeric criteria values |
| TOPSIS Score | Relative closeness to the ideal solution |
| Rank | Final ranking based on TOPSIS score |

**Interpretation:**
- Alternatives with **higher TOPSIS scores** are closer to the ideal best solution.
- **Rank 1** represents the most optimal alternative based on the provided criteria, weights, and impacts.
- The tabular output ensures **transparent and reproducible** decision-making.
